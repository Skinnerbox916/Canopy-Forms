# Future Features

## Separate Label/Value for Select Options

**Current behavior (v3.2):** Users enter the option name once, and it's used as both the label (what users see) and value (what gets stored).

**Future enhancement:** Add ability to specify different values from labels. For example:
- Label: "United States" → Value: `US` (for CRM/API integration)
- Label: "Pro Plan - $29/month" → Value: `plan_pro` (for billing system compatibility)

**Use case:** Enables advanced integrations with CRMs, payment gateways, and other systems that require specific data formats or codes.

**Future enhancement:** Stand-alone front end. Canopy Forms-branded for use by individuals
**Email to Submitter** The ability to configure a form to send an email to the person who submitted it. I would require an email editor with is a lot of extra work. May need to wait until a major level bump which would also include some customization of the hosted solution.
